# horiseon
Submitted in fulfillment of week one coursework.

We received a Development folder from Horiseon containing CSS and HTML. Consolidated CSS and edited HTML to reflect Customer's mock-up layout image using best coding practices to reflect proper HTML semantics.

HTML elements follow logical styling and positioning, heading elements falling in logical order. All images are embedded in HTML with accessible alt descriptions. The website's title has been updated to better communicate Horiseons's brand.
